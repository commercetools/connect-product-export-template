# Full Export
This module provides a REST-API hosted on commercetools-provided infrastructure. Once the API is triggered, it exports all products under the specific store of the commercetools project, and then import to the external search index.

## Get started
#### Install your search-specific SDK 
Assuming you have already published your developed SDK as a package to the npm registry, please run following npm command under full-export folder to install the package.
```
$ npm install <your-search-index-sdk>
```
#### Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
#### Run integration test
```
$ npm run test:integration
```
#### Run the application in local environment
```
$ npm run start
```
## Development

#### Set the required environment variables

Before starting the development, we advise users to create a .env file in order to help them in local development.
      
For that, we also have a template file .env.example with the required environement variables for the project to run successfuly. To make it work, rename the file from `.env.example` to `.env`. Remember to fill the variables with your values.

#### Execute full synchronization
After deployment by connect service or starting up the application in local environment, you can trigger the full synchronization by sending HTTP POST request to REST-API as below
```
curl 
--location 
--request POST 'https://<your-search-connector-host>/fullSync/<your-commercetools-store-key>' \
--data ''

```
Remind that you need to change the host name and append the key of commercetools Store as query parameter in the URL.
